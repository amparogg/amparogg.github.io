## Sumary

My name is Amparo Garcia Garcia and I am from Spain. After finishing my bachelor in Mathematics at University of Salamanca in 2018, I decided to move to Russia in order to enroll at University Lobachevsky in Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia.
I studied russian for one year and currently I am studying my first year of the master in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, which is taught in russian.

Although my native tongue is spanish, I also can speak fluently in English as well as in Russian, and I have some knowledge of German too. My ability to learn and my hard work can be shown because I learned Russian in one year and, although I still have many things to learn in this wide language, I can follow my master classes and I manage to pass all my subjects with high marks and hard work. Also I have some knowledge in programming languages such as C, C+, C++, Python, Mathematica, Matlab, Maple..., most of them I studied by myself.

I am really interested in getting new perspectives on different issues, broading my horizons and meeting people from different countries and cultures. Regarding sports, my favourite ones are horse-riding and swimming. 

My goal is to become a completed mathematician with knowledge of programming languages, and, if possible, I want to work modelling different processes which happen in our daily life in order to solve problems or to foreseen some trend or future events.

To sum up with I think I only want to do my little bit based on my work to help development and people, because I think we all live in a world and we must try to make it better for everyone.

## Experience

Since I started studying my degree, I have several times to do projects in C, C++, C#, Mathematica, Python, Matlab and Maple.
For example I had to programmed Runge Kutta, Adam's Moulton method and other numerical methods in Mathematica. Also I programmed some models for genes expression in matlab. Also I programmed a lot in Python relating to Machine Learning, a basic example can be found here:[Basic Python](https://github.com/amparogg/MachineLearning-)
